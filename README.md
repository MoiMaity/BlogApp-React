# BlogApp-React
A blogging website made with React JS and backend managed by JSON Server.

Install the required node-modules from package.json files.

Then start the development server using 'npm run start'.
Also, as I am using JSON server type in a new terminal 'npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000'.

This should build the app totally and will be working fine.
